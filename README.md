# Notice
Use this repo in favor of ffruhr/ffapi as it is a replacement for the inactive, one-man-shot "ffruhr".

Due to the fact that github organization ffruhr is a one-man-show and that it is inactive for quite a long time (last commit from that person was from 4th june of 2018, more then 1 year ago & has pending pull requests, created in 2016) we decided to create a fork.

Current Freifunk Community Directory is still linking to 25 community API files hosted in that old repo.
To let all affected Freifunk communities that were previously organized via Freifunk Ruhrgebiet to update their community API files (without being forced to host them, themselfs this repo was forked. 

Your pull requests are warmly welcomed. 
To ensure your PR is merged as fast as possible team be Freifunk Hamm we guaranty that this github organization is NOT a one-man-show (at least 4 persons).

If you want to create your own github repo for your community API file, feel free to do so. Do not forget to create a PR against
https://github.com/freifunk/directory.api.freifunk.net to make your repo aktive in the community directory. Please let us know when you do so - to let us cleanup our repo accordingly.

BTW:
Freifunk Hamm did multiple attemps to get into contact with Christian Bischoff (github name: DaCHRIS, Orga ffruhr) for multiple weeks to join the github organisation ffruhr directly, before creating this fork. Attemps via slack (freifunk.slack.com, PM to user "Chris", via xing.de, even calls to his company servergurus.de where he is the authorized officer are not answered for multiples attemps - not a single person in that company answered these calls. Looks like that company is inactive, too.
